<h2>My Story</h2>
<br>

 <p2>
 Hello, I am Tianna Parmar from the Aga Khan Academy Mombasa's graduating class of 2023.
 I'm a 14-year-old student who is fueled by ambition and innovation through sustainability and passion.

 <br>
 <br>

     The Aga Khan Academy Mombasa is home to 260 residential students. 
     That many student, along with around 50 residential teachers, some of thier families, and the support staff
     means that there is constantly a mass production of food going on in the school for all three meals of the day and 
     two daily snacks. This unfortunately means a lot of food waste, to give you a perspective of how severe the food wastage
     really is, imagine a 55 gallon trash can filled around three-quarters of the way full with rice. All that perfectly 
     good food goes to waste. 
     
     Thus, the creation of this web app is to ensure that the whole of the AKA,M community is aware of the severity of 
     food waste at our school and why it needs immediate attention. This web app contains information about food waste,
     hunger and ways to prevent them both at basic yet effective ways.
